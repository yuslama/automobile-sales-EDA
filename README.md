# Comprehensive Analysis of Automobile Sales Data

## Project Overview

This project aims to perform a comprehensive analysis of an auto sales dataset. The dataset includes various attributes related to orders, products, customers, and sales. By exploring and analyzing this data, we aim to uncover insights that can inform business decisions, identify trends, and improve sales strategies.

## Objectives

- To load and understand the structure of the dataset.
- To clean and preprocess the data for accurate analysis.
- To perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and relationships in the data.
- To summarize the findings and provide actionable insights.

## Project Structure

- **data**: Directory containing the dataset.
- **notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks for data analysis.
- **alternative preview**: Sometime the github failed to render the .ipynb so open this instead [datalab](https://www.datacamp.com/datalab/w/d20526f4-4361-493a-9da2-e06ec942e8c1/edit/automobileSales.ipynb).
- **visualizations**: Directory for storing visualizations.
- **README.md**: Project documentation.

## Tableau Visualizations

To enhance the analysis and provide interactive visual insights, I have created Tableau visualizations based on the dataset. You can explore these visualizations by following the link below:
